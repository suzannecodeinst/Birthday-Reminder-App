# Birthday Reminder App

The Birthday reminder app allows the user to access a birthday spreadsheet they have set up in their Google account. The app allows them to check birthdays that are due in a specific selected month, and to also update the spreadsheet by adding birthdays to a selected month.

I set up the workarea and connected the Google sheets by following the API demo from the Love Sandwiches walkthrough project. I also consistently checked in with this project as a reminder of how to keep testing along the way and organise the python code.
